# possibility to assess the error on:
# - PHASE 1
# - number_of_revolutions_left_ball
# - estimated_time_left
# - PHASE 2 - if both quantities are correct, we can estimate predicted_number_cutoff exactly (without any
# errors on the measurements).
# - predicted_number_cutoff
# - predicted_number (less important)
# - diamond: FORWARD, BLOCKER, NO_DIAMOND (position of the diamond)

# HYPER PARAMETER RELATION WITH QUANTITIES
# - estimated_time_left (NOTHING) BALL SPEED IS NOT NEEDED.
# - number_of_revolutions_left_ball (NOTHING) BALL SPEED IS NOT NEEDED.
# - PHASE 2 - if both quantities are correct, we can estimate predicted_number_cutoff exactly (without any
# errors on the measurements).
# - initial_number (NOTHING) WHEEL SPEED IS NOT NEEDED.
# - predicted_number_cutoff
# - predicted_number (less important)
# - diamond: FORWARD, BLOCKER, NO_DIAMOND (position of the diamond)

#     # constants to optimise.
#   EXPECTED_BOUNCING_SHIFT_FORWARD_DIAMOND = 16
#   EXPECTED_BOUNCING_SHIFT_BLOCKER_DIAMOND = 6
#   MOVE_TO_NEXT_DIAMOND = 0  # due to the intrinsic speed. might change something. to be removed maybe later.

# Important
# Actually we don't need BALL_SPEED, WHEEL_SPEED, CUTOFF_SPEED !
